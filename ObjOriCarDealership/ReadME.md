# Car Dealearship Using Object-Oriented Programming WS4
This project uses Object Oriented Programming to simulate a Car Dealearship using Getters and Setters, Constructors, File Read and Write, and a few error catchers to simulate a Car Dealearship.


## Roadmap

- 1st I looked through the documatation to see what was needed in each class and be very careful to follow the instructuions excatly 

- 2nd once done looking over the documatation made all the classes need to make a functining app. 

- 3rd Look at every class and add the needed code to complete this project.
-I started with Vechicle beause that was teh eaisest all it needed was setters and getters of ints, strings and doubles.

-Next I went to my Dealership class whaich asked me to use an ArrayList to get the Vechicles Price, Model, Year, Color, Mileage, and Type. Also within the Dealership class I needed to have added teh ability to add or remove vehicles to the list and List all teh vechicles present at the time.

-Then I went into my DealershipFileManager class to make use of the BufferReader class and PrintWriter Class to simulate reading and writing from the file

-Next I went into my UserInterace class which was the hardest to do. This class was just asking the user for what car they were looking for by year, color make, and model. Aslo adding and removie vechiles to the Dealership list. As an added bonus added a if they weren't satififed they can call a simulated number.

-Last jsut adding the UserInterface ui to the Main to make the code work in the console.
