# About Financial Calculator 
This project is a simple Java Calculator that provides a set of financial calculators for clients and using the Java Terminal to see a mortgage, future and present values of anything you like 
such as a house or just looking into anything else you can think of.




project was frustrating and fun at the same time. Each one of these calculators is for Mortgage, Future, and Present Values. Included in this project are screenshots of each output. 
What I found interesting is that the code doesn't change all that much from one to another, and looking for the formulas for each value was a little tough.
