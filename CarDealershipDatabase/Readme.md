# About Car Dealership Database 💾
For this workshop, our task is to design a comprehensive car dealership database, 
including all necessary tables to support its operations. 
The script must also initialize the database with pre-populated sample data to ensure 
functionality from the start.

# Technology Used 🖥️
For this project, I used SQL tools like `DBeaver` and `MySQL` to design and 
implement the car dealership database. 
This involved creating structured tables, populating them with initial data, 
and writing SQL queries to validate functionality. Additionally, 
I generated an SQL file to test and ensure the database operates correctly.

# Roadmap 🏗️
1. I started by reviewing the documentation to determine the essential components for the car dealership database. 
This helped me outline the necessary tables, relationships, and initial data required for a functional design.
2. Created my First SQL File named 'Der'
