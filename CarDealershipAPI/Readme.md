# About Workshop 9 Connecting your Car Dealership to a Database 💾
For this workshop, I developed a RESTful API based on a previous project where I built a car dealership system using Java and the MySQL Driver. 
The project transitioned from using CSV files to directly connecting with a MySQL database that I designed and implemented myself.

# Technology Used 🖥️
For this project, I designed and implemented a car dealership database using SQL tools such as `DBeaver` and `MySQL`. I created structured tables, populated them with initial data, and wrote SQL queries to verify data integrity and functionality. To ensure smooth deployment, I generated a testable `.sql` file that validates the database setup.

I then used `Java Spring Boot` with relevant Web dependencies to build backend tools for interacting with the database. After launching the application, I leveraged `Postman` to test and confirm successful API calls and database connectivity.
